## Dancing BB8 (WIP)
This repo features a React app that connects to a  [BB8 Droid](http://www.sphero.com/starwars/bb8) via the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web).

Features:
- Typescript
- Reactive interface with RXjs to send commands to BB8, inspired by [this](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/demos/blob/gh-pages/bluetooth-toy-bb8/index.html).
- React wrappers to connect and control the droid.
